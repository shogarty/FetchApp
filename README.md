# FetchApp
This is an android app for a take home assessment. It's meant to take data from an online JSON file and sort it. 
It's very bare-bones, but this is also my first time ever working with Android. It's also my first time creating any sort of actual mobile app at all.
Oh, and it's also my first time doing anything that involves front end work, and...I actually don't think I have any experience grabbing stuff from online using an API either.
I feel like I must have done that once at some point, but that also is the part that gave me the most trouble.
That and I tried doing this in Kotlin at first because I wanted to challenge myself. 
Yeah, that was a bad idea, trying to learn a whole new language on top of everything else burnt a good chunk of my time. 

The point is - if this assessment is bare-bones and turned in at the literal last minute, that is for a reason,
and that reason is not because I didn't try or that I started too late. Anyways, by some miracle it does work, 
and if nothing else I'm proud of myself for figuring everything out in in the week I had to do this.

The app should just run automatically once opened. It will display the items from the json file in the following format:

Name: name | List Id: listid | Item Id: item id
